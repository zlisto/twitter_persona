ladies and gentlemen please welcome Elon Musk everybody thanks for coming what do you think of my hat all right I'm gonna I'm gonna sign the hat and I'm going to throw it out all right all right i love you guys too uh so uh well thank you for coming out in support of this very important um uh Supreme Court uh race in Wisconsin um it's it's actually something that I think it's it's it's one of those things that may seem like it's obviously important in in the state of Wisconsin but I think it could actually be important uh for the country as well and and maybe for the world so so the you so the the House majority right now is razor thin it's really just a few seats and if um if if the Supreme Court is able to redraw the districts uh they will they will jerrymander the districts and deprive Wisconsin of two House seats on the Republican side yeah exactly the result of that could be that the house switches uh to a democratic house yes indeed um and then they will try to stop all of the government reforms that we are we're doing and we're getting done for you the American people so so the the reforms that that were getting done in DC thanks to uh President Trump and his great team um are are really profound really we're the goal is very simple it's to restore merit um and freedom so that's that's what it comes down to so America is the land of of freedom and opportunity so we want to we want to restore ind individual freedoms freedom of speech just in general uh get the government off your back um so and and then make sure that you succeed in in the United States as a function of your hard work and your talent and nothing else so these are these are really noble and important principles and and also and I'll talk about more about this uh you know all night really as much as as long as you guys want to hear about it um but but as as you may as you may have seen with stuff that we've posted on the doge.gov website and the Doge handle on the X platform there is a tremendous amount of waste and fraud in the federal government like shocking really it's it's insane it's really wild so Like I mean it was inevitable that at least a few Soros operatives would be in the audience get my regards to George say hi to George for me usa usa usa usa usa yep i mean it was inevitable i was waiting for that one so I mean I mean yeah thank you thanks guys um yeah i mean I I mean isn't it isn't it shocking how much violence and hatred is coming from the left i mean isn't this supposed isn't it supposed to be the the party they claim to be the party of empathy and yet they're burning they're burning Teslas and shooting up dealerships and calling for the death of the president and me i'm like guys you know this is this is insane like they're to gone psycho i mean it's really like uh I totally understand if somebody doesn't want to buy a product yeah it's up to you it was free country you know but you don't have to burn it down okay but much that's somebody else's car leave it alone you got to get back thanks guys yeah so man that the arrangement level on the left is just like it's blown my mind frankly i mean I'm like what is going on it's they've just lost it next level i'm like um it's like whoa um and I I I sort of wonder what's you know the legacy media is in part to blame for this and maybe primarily to blame for this because you know you know it's really terrible it's like if if they keep calling you know they they've called obviously called President Trump every name in the book you know I think there was one article that that called the president worse than Hitler Mousolini and Stalin combined i'm like uh actually President Trump's not killed anyone in fact he's very good at stopping wars not starting them so you know we're really very different maybe we need to uh add some more history lessons back in schools because I don't know if people understand uh you know what uh the difference do do they know what Hitler was leading Stan did it seems they they don't um I mean it's just indicative of the poor quality of of education pushed by the National Department of Education so you know we that's why we we we want to restore freedom to the states to this let the states decide on the educational agenda and not have something pushed by a bunch of neo-Marxists in DC so I mean it is astounding how much anti-American propaganda is pushed on on on kids today in schools it's mind-blowing it's like what the hell's going on you know so anyway but on a more positive note uh we we we have this petition um you know to sort of against uh activist judges because judges should be in simply um interpreting the law and not making the law um so in appreciation for the support of uh people in in signing this petition against activist judges we just want judges to be judges you know which is a reasonable thing to ask for um and um we're obviously obviously seeing like some crazy stuff in in in DC where uh you know it seems like the it's like any any federal judge can stop any action by the president the you know the of the United States this is insane like we we this this has got to stop it's got to stop at the federal level and at the state level um but let me first hand out two $1 million checks in appreciation okay so the first check goes to Nicholas Jacobs all right now I should say that the the reason you know the reason for the checks is that it's it's really just to get get attention it's it's like we we need to get attention and and somewhat inevitably um when I do this these things the u you know the the sort of uh it causes the legacy media to like kind of lose their minds and and and and then and then they'll they'll run it on every news channel and I'm like I I couldn't pay them to the it would cost like 10 times more or you know to get the kind of coverage that we get so all right so many welcome thank you all right all right you can just I guess take it if you want we'll get we'll get I think we'll get you a real one too so and then the second one second one is to Eatarina Diesel let's see hopefully here so well and you know like I said this is just helpful for getting it getting attention and then like it's it's kind of fun to see the legacy media lose their minds over it too so love you too so yeah so see hello thank you congratulations thank you all right all right congratulations all right so we're also um going to be announcing or we are announcing now a a a program uh sort of a a get out the vote program uh that's the web page should be going live uh I think around now uh which is at the America Packac website or just go to the America pack x account and uh the single biggest challenge I think is actually just making people aware that there is this very important election um and there's both the the very important election for judge Shimmel as well as the um deciding on on adding voter ID to the Wisconsin Wisconsin constitution ution which is very very important so it's it's really it's quite shocking that I mean you can sort of tell where voter fraud is happening where they ban ID you know like why would you ban ID like in New York and California it's like illegal to show ID at an election well why would I can't imagine why that would be the case so um so two really important things um is uh is really just sure ensure judicial integrity on Tuesday and and then the the voter ID thing and um you know it's April Fool's Day uh so uh and it is it's it's like I think most people aren't aware like I said most people aren't aware that there is this this important election um that most people don't even know that there's an election at all um and uh or if they do they aren't sure exactly when and where it is uh and they aren't sure yet of or they don't realize just how important it is um they think it it's well it's just you know some kind of judicial thing that's not that important but it actually what they're do what what's happening on Tuesday is a vote for uh the the which party controls the US House of House of Representatives that is why it is so so significant and whichever party controls the house uh you know it it it to a significant degree controls the country which then steers the course of western civilization so it's like I I feel like this is one of those things that that may not seem that it's going to affect the entire destiny of humanity but I think it will no pressure yeah so um it's it's a super it's a super big deal and and the the fact that I'm here in person like I'm not voting it in i'm here in person i'm And they're Yeah so and there there were quite a few death threats I have to tell you uh that I was like my security team said "Well it's it's actually gone down from yesterday to today it went down from 18,000 to 17,000." So I'm like "Oh maybe it's getting better you know." Um but you can see like how crazy some of these people are um you know look look at the the the two uh sort of people that tried to assassinate President Trump you know I mean that was uh and one you know they both almost succeeded um so it's it's real like it's not like some imaginary thing um so anyway so what what we're announcing is is kind of like a a block captain program where um somebody can sign up to knock on doors in their zip code and encourage people to to uh well make people aware that there is a vote um and then aware of how important the vote is so you can uh sign up to be kind of a block captain for your zip code on the Americ yeah and if you do it's it's like basically 20 bucks for just taking a photo with somebody it's pretty straightforward you just knock on doors in your neighborhood and and and give them either a digital or a paper you know picture of uh you know Justice Brad Shiml it can be an approximation it doesn't have to be exact um but uh and and and they just have to say thumbs up and hold a picture of of Judge Shimmel and that's it and you get $20 sounds It's pretty easy it's easy money so but we're the the whole point of it is just to make people aware of the election um and and to say that there is an election it's on Tuesday and it's super important please vote but I think without something like this um we're we actually are in in serious danger of losing the election this is very important to put put in mind if you if you look at the betting market odds so if you look at sort of the poly market or kshi like the betting markets it varies between 85% and 90% probability of loss for just a shimmel that's the current situation so we got to we got to pull a rabbit out of the hat next level it's got we actually got to have a steady stream of rabbits out of the hat like it's an arc of rabbits flying through the air and and landing in a in a bony booth interesting picture uh Grock could probably make that picture um so uh that's that's basically what's needed is is is we need to generate an anomaly in the matrix um and because I think there's currently uh that there the Dems are 100,000 votes ahead but if actually if just if the people that voted for President Trump simply vote on Tuesday uh we will win that's actually all it takes just vote boom done trick tree so so we basically need to to drag net the state it's like everybody's going to mobilize everywhere like crazy for the next 48 hours um and I I think this will be important for the future of civilization it's that significant so you don't hear me saying that very often it's it's a big deal um so vote for Judge Supercharge Shiml i call him supercharge Shiml so um let's see um so with that I think we can um do some do Q&A if you guys would like to do some Q&A uh and I'm happy to answer any questions i can be you know about Doge or whatever you'd like to hear about um because I think um if you ask questions that the public would be interested in hearing then uh you know those those snippets will go all over the place and it will be helpful to the the public um you know at large and maybe even beyond beyond our country
